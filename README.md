# MSCG-network-for-predicting-VIVs
The code is for surrogate modeling the vehicle-induced vibrations of girder birdges, in which multi-scale convolution GRU network is adopted. The code and data will open-access after the paper is published. The included code and data is as follows:
(1) train_model.py
(2) predict_model.py
(3) model_mscg.py
(4) data_numbr_roadlv_a.mat
